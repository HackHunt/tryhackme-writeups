`nmap -sV -Pn <IP>`

![Open Ports](images/open_ports.png)

Looks like we have two ports open: `21, 22`.

Let's try to connect via `ftp` using `anonymous:anonymous` as credentials.

![FTP Connect](images/ftp_connect.png)

I looked around and found `user.txt` in the home directory of **melodias**.

I found an ordinary folder in the root directory, `notread`. Umm, we gonna :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Found two files, let's get the files in our local machine and decrypt it.

![Get Files](images/get_files.png)
> Now that we have the files. Disconnect `ftp`.

Try importing the key `private.asc`.

![Need Password](images/need_pass.png)
> It seems like we need passpharse to import the key.

We can crack this using `JohnTheRipper`. Before start cracking we need to convert the file into `John` format using `gpg2john`. CMD -> `gpg2john private.asc > privateJohn`

Start cracking with command - `john --wordlist=rockyou.txt privateJohn`

![Passwrd](images/get_pass.png)
> Now that we have the password we can import the key.

To import the key - `gpg --import private.asc`. When asked for the password, enter the password you got from the previous result.

![Import Key](images/import_key.png)
> The key is imported. We can try to decrypt the *backup.pgp* file.

To decrypt the file - `gpg backup.pgp`. When asked for the password, enter the password you got from John.

Once done, let's check the content of the file.

![Got Password](images/get_psswd.png)
> Seems like a backup for `passwd` file.

Interestingly, we have the password for the `root`. But it is encrypted. Let's copy the password for decryption.

COMMAND -> `cat backup | grep root > root_psswd.txt`

![Get Root Password](images/get_root_hash.png)
> We have the hash in a file. So we can use `hashcat` to decrypt the password.

To run hashcat, we need to know the type of encryption. In this case `$6$` means SHA256/Unix. In `hashcat`, it is denoted as **1800**.

To know more about [hashcat][3], read this!

Command to decrypt is `hashcat -m 1800 --force root_passwd.txt --wordlist rockyou.txt`

Alternatively, you can use `John` with command - `john root_passwd.txt --wordlist=rockyou.txt`

Now that we have the password, we can `ssh` as `root` and get the root flag.

![SSH ROOT](images/ssh_root.png)
> BAAM! We have the access.

You know what to do next :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
