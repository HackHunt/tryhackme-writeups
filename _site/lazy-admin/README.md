# [LazyAdmin TryHackMe Writeup/Walkthrough][1]
Easy linux machine to practice your skills

#### Scan the machine.
> If you are unsure how to tackle this, I recommend checking out the [Nmap Tutorials by Hack Hunt][2].

`nmap -sV -Pn <IP>`

Looks like we have two ports open: `22, 80`

Let's check the website.

> Hmm, looks like a default Apache Web page. I checked the source code nothing much there either.

I ran the `gobuster` to find directories -> `gobuster -u http://<IP> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`

![GoBuster Results](images/gobuster.jpg)
> One interesting result I found here was **/content**.

So, I went to `http://<IP>/content` and it looks like we have something here. I ran gobuster again -> `gobuster -u http://<IP>/content -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`

![GoBuster Results](images/gobuster_content.jpg)

The interesting ones here are:
- /as
- /inc

`/as` is a login page. So, I check the `/inc` directory and I found some pretty interesting stuff.
- I got the version for the **SweetRice** from the file latest i.e. 1.5.1.
- I found a folder called `mysql_backup`. I checked the directory and there is a backup file. Let's check the content of the file.

> I found a username and hashed password for the database.

![Content](images/cat_pass.jpg)

Next Stop, [Crackstation][3]! Paste the hash here.

![Crackstation Result](images/crack_pass.jpg)

Now, we have a username and password -> `manager:Password123`. Go to the login page.

![Login Page](images/login_page.jpg)
> Use credentials `manager:Password123` and you will get the access.

Meanwhile! When I was in a jam, I search for exploits for `sweet rice` on `searchsploit`

![Searchsploit Results](images/searchsploit.jpg)
> As we have the Access to the admin's account. We can try CSRF. What more interesting is **CSRF + PHP**.

I copied the file to my current directory to make changes -> `cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/40700.html 40700.html`

Open the file and change the IP address to the target machine's IP.

![Change Content](images/change_file.jpg)
> After saving the file. Open the file and as its a CSRF it will automatically gives you a page to add **ADS**.

Paste the **PHP Reverse Shell Code** with you IP and PORT of your choice. (You can get the [Reverse Shell][4] from here)

![Shell Code](images/php_rev.jpg)
> Name anything you like, but do remember the name.

Click DONE and the file is uploaded. You will find the file in `/content/inc/ads`.

![Upload Success](images/location.jpg)

Before opening the file, start a listener using `nc -lvnp <PORT>`

Now open the file and you will see a successful connection.

![Got SHELL](images/got_shell.jpg)
> The first thing I do is **SHELL STABLIZE**. This can be done using -> `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`

As we have the access, now we can get the **user flag**. It is stored in the `home` directory.

### Privilege Escalation

For enumeration, I start by doing `sudo -l` and check for SUIDs. Fortunately, there is a `perl` file which we can run.

![SUDO](images/sudo_l.jpg)

It seems like it is executing another file `/etc/copy.sh`.

![Backup File Content](images/backup.jpg)

So, I checked the content and the permission of that file.

![File Content](images/content.jpg)
> As you can see that this file has write permission for all groups.

OSINT! I check for executing SHELL on [GTFOBins][5] for bash and found simple `bash` command can be used.

Now, we can append for change the content of the file to just `bash` ->  `echo "bash" > /etc/copy.sh`

![Change Content](images/change_content.jpg)

Run the backup file as we have the permission.

![Root Access](images/root_access.jpg)
> BAAM! We got the root access.

You know what to do next :satisfied:
